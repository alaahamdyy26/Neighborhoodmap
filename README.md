# MyReads Project
This is an application created with  **`ReactJS`.**

I used `Google Maps API` along with `FourSquare API`

This is a simple Map app featuring my eight top visited places, showing them on the map & giving details about them (exact location, rating, contact info.)


**To get started**
install `node` & `npm`
install all project dependencies with npm install
start the development server with `npm start` - this will start the project automatically in a localhost
